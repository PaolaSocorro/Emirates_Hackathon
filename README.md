The theme of this hackathon was "Flight Search using Personas" and we wanted to put an emphasis on personal exploration.

Most of our travel ideas and suggestions come from family, friends, and advertisements. We wanted to give a more personalized flight search experience by using Dr. Stanley Plog's research on [Travel Personalities](http://besttripchoices.com/travel-personalities/). We created a shortened version of Dr. Plog's personality quiz and returned a list of flights to cities that is customized to the results of that quiz. For each city, the lowest fare with its departure and return times are listed and we also provide a list of activities provided by Xola.

## <a name="version2"></a>Version 2.0
We want to add more demographic data such as age, gender, and previous travel destinations paired with machine learning to take Path Finder to the next level of personalization. We hope this can scale to be the next Netflix of travel.
